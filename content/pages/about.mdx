# Me

Ola, my name is Tiago and I am a dad, a husband , a strategist working in the innovation space and a
developer apprentice. A couple of years back I moved to Singapore with my better half and our
2 kids have been born in the little red dot.

I have started this website as a small experiment to teach myself how to code, to share that
journey and to put "pen to paper" on stuff that I like to do and to think about.

Hope you enjoy!

# Us

Briefly describing me wouldn't be complete without sharing a picture of my family 😎!
For some reason I couldn't find a nice picture with the four of us together, go figure!

# Photography

I have always toyed with the idea of picking photography, my first camera was a canon DSLR
with a 50mm f1.4 prime lens and I loved the stills, the blurred effect and the process. However,
I was never a fan of carrying the camera and lenses around. In fact, I hated it so much that I
ended up selling everything.
 
Last year (2019) I started to notice that Diogo, my youngest, had way less nice pictures and portraits than Monica, my oldest.
I was gutted, wanted to pick up photography again, but didn't want to break the bank, neither to have to carry a ton with me everytime that I wanted to take some shots.

Enter my ricoh:

<figure>
  <img src={ricoh} alt="my ricoh camera" />
  <figcaption style={{ textAlign: `center` }}> my ricoh griii, design on figma</figcaption>
</figure>

Small, powerfull and punchy - I started photography again.

Here are my latest pictures on instagram:

# Tech that I use

This little corner on the internet (a.k.a my digital garden) was built with gatsby,
and I am using airtable and convertkit to manage emails,
some of the pictures are being hosted in cloudinary, the blog posts and pages are
written in Markdown and MDX.

In short a genuine [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) digital asset 🤣.
